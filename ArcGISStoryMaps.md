## Fun features in ArcGIS StoryMaps

Learn how to create fun and interactive features in ArcGIS StoryMaps

Duration: 15 mins

### Map Tour

**Why did I use it?**

- I used Map Tour for the first time in my job application. I really like it because I was able to map locations that were influential to building my passion for GIS, starting with my undergraduate university up until my future employment opportunities.

**Advantages:**

- as you scroll on the page, the map will automatically bring you to the next stop
- can be used as a timeline for travel
- can add images to support the map
- different layout options
    - can be guided: media focused, map focused
    - can be explorer: list, grid

**Disadvantages:**
- the connecting lines between stops can make the overview of the map look messy, depending on how many stops you have

**How to create a map tour**

1. To create a map tour, click the green dot with a + in the center of it. Scroll down to **Immersive** content block. Click ```Map tour```.

### Swipe tool

**Why did I use it?**

- I used the swipe tool in my StoryMap to compare suitability layers, before and aftering they were geoprocessed.

**Advantages:**

- user can easily interact with the data
- great for comparing two images

**Disadvantages:**

- if directly comparing two images, they must be the same size

## Example StoryMaps

- The StoryMap I created for Week 9 was for a job application. Since it includes personal information, I will not be including the link in GitHub. The link can be found in my submitted timesheet.

- Another StoryMap I've created can be found here: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b44aca856eba4a10bac4c3c0c70bd5e0
