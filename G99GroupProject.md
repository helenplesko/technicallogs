## Finding Lindsay transit data

- One group member already acquired the data
- I did some more searching and found where the hub of real-time data is

### Transitland

URL: https://www.transit.land/feeds/f-kawartha~on~ca

#### About 

- stores the GTFS feed for Lindsay transit
- has current static data, but it is not up to date
	- this dataset is missing the orange transit line, which was added to the routes in Feb 2024
- have to make a free account to download the data
- nearly every day the feed is posted

> [!NOTE]
> I tried requesting an account to download the data, but received no confirmation email, so I am not able to sign in.
> We may have to just continue with older data for the time being.

## Uploading Lindsay transit data to ArcGIS Online

Learn how to download public data from an ArcGIS Hub and upload it to ArcGIS Online as a hosted feature service

Assumption(s):
- User has an ArcGIS Account

Duration: 15 mins

### Steps

1. Visit the public **ArcGIS Hub** where Lindsay transit data are located: https://hub.arcgis.com/documents/ca68660b0e3e47a09a667d2f0963df99/about 

2. Browse the available data under **You may be interested in**.

3. Click ```Bus Routes``` feature service to bring you to an overview of its service.

4. Click ```Download``` to bring you to a list of **Download Options**.

5. In this case, we want the **Shapefile**. Find the shapefile on the list, click ```Download```. The zipfile including all shapefile data will automatically start downloading to the computer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the folder zipped! ArcGIS Online will want you to upload a new item in a zipped file.

6. In a separate browser, sign into **ArcGIS Online**: https://www.arcgis.com/index.html# 

7. Once signed in, click ```Content```.

8. To keep files organized, on the lefthand side, click the ```folder icon``` next to **Folders** to create a new folder, where you will be storing the new items.

9. When in the folder, click ```New item``` at the top lefthand side of the page.

10. Drag and drop the zipped folder onto the page. AGOL will show that it is recognizes the uploaded folder was a **shapefile**.

11. We want the **zipped folder** AND the **hosted feature layer**, so select ```Add ___.zip and create a hosted feature layer```. Click ```Next```.

12. Give your shapefile a proper **name** and click ```Save```.

13. The shapefile will now appear in your AGOL with its associated hosted feature layer!

14. Repeat all steps for Lindsay's Bus Stops

:tada: *Congratulations! You have now learned how to upload the Lindsay, Ontario, transit data to ArcGIS Online*

> [!TIP]
> Click the hosted feature layer and view in Map Viewer to see the data on a map.

> [!WARNING]
> After further inspection of the data, it was discovered that some bus stops were missing. Further processing must be done to ensure the general public can rely on the data to navigate around the city.

## Exploring ArcGIS Hub (Part 1)

Learn the functionalities of ArcGIS Hub and explore it to see if it is a possible web solution

Duration: 15 mins

### What is ArcGIS Hub?

- Application that you can use to easily build a website 
- Customize the website to be able to share ArcGIS Online content internally or with the public

### Advantages and disadvantages of ArcGIS Hub

| Advantages  | Disadvantages  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Easy to use, drag and drop items  | Need credits to store and process data^  |
| Included with Basic ArcGIS Online Account  | Moving things around the page can be finicky   | 
| Can customize the theme/look of the hub  |   |

^More on credits: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/credits.htm

### Things to consider before creating your Hub

- What is the purpose of your Hub?
- Who is your audience? 
- Who will be able to access the data in your hub?
- What theme do you want your Hub to follow (e.g., colors, images, fonts, etc.)

### Would Hub be useful for our group project?

- **Yes**, non-GIS users will be able to navigate through the site
- **Yes**, you don't need a lot of coding experience to use this web solution
- **Yes**, it is part of ArcGIS Online, so Fleming can host it for the public
- **No**, our purpose isn't to share the data with the public, just display it, so not sure if this is the best option for us

## Exploring Public Transit Toolbox in ArcGIS Pro

Learn about the capabilities of the Public Transit Toolbox in ArcGIS Pro

Duration: 30 mins

### What is the Public Transit Toolbox?

- Toolbox in ArcGIS Pro that is used for displaying, converting, editing, and analyzing public transit data
- In this toolbox, there is an analysis toolset and a conversion toolset
	- analysis toolset used to analyze public transit data
	- conversion toolset used to convert to/from GTFS datasets

### Why is this toolbox of interest to our project?

- Since our group is working with public transit data, we decided to explore the tools within this toolbox
- We have GTFS Lindsay transit data, which can be processed using these tools

### GTFS to Public Transit Data Model

Learn how to use the **General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) to Public Transit Data Model** tool to convert the GTFS data to a set of feature classes and tables that represent the transit data

Assumption(s):
- You have an ArcGIS Account with access to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online
- You already have the GTFS csv files downloaded

Duration: 30 mins

#### Steps

1. Open up a new project map in ArcGIS Pro. Save the project in a directory of your choice.

2. In the **Catalog Pane**:
    - Right click on ```Folders```
    - Click ```Add Folder Connection```
    - Navigate to the folder where your CSV files are saved on your local computer
	- Click ```OK```.
	- Expand the newly connected folder to see its contents

3. Once the folder connection is made, click the ```Analysis``` tab:
	- Click ```Environments```
	- Click the globe next to **Output Coordinate System**
	- Choose Coordinate System **NAD 1983 CSRS UTM ZONE 17N**
	- Click ```OK```

4. In the **Catalog Pane**:
	- Right click on your **geodatabase**
	- Click ```New```
	- Click ```Feature Dataset```
	- Ensure the **Output Geodatabase** is the one youâ€™d like to store it in
	- Give the feature dataset a meaningful **name**
	- Ensure the **coordinate system** is the same one set in the environments
	- Click ```Run```

5. Click the ```Analysis``` tab 

6. Click ```Tools```

7. In the **Toolboxes** directory:
	- Click ```Public Transit Tools``` to expand the toolbox
	- Click ```Conversion``` to expand the toolset
	- Click ```GTFS to Public Transit Data Model```
	- This will bring up the **GTFS to Public Transit Data Model** Geoprocessing window

8. In the **Geoprocessing Window**:
	- For **Input GTFS Folders**, find the folder that olds your csv files
	- For **Target Feature Dataset**, choose the newly made feature dataset
	- Leave all other defaults
	- Click ```Run```

> [!NOTE]
> The target feature dataset chosen must not already have public transit data model feature classes within it.
> If the geodatabase being used is enterprise, it must not be versioned.

9. The feature classes and table will automatically be added to the map.

10. Explore the new data

| Item  | Type  | Location  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| LineVariantElements  | Line  | Feature Dataset  | shows the route of the transit vehicle  |
| Stops  | Point  | Feature Dataset  | shows the bus stops  |
| CalendarExceptions  | Table  | Geodatabase  | ServiceID, ExceptionDate, ExceptionType |
| Calendars  | Table  | Geodatabase  | Empty; shows GServiceID, days of the week, StartDate and EndDate  |
| Lines  | Table  | Geodatabase  | shows 4 bus routes and route type  |
| LineVariants  | Table  | Geodatabase  | shows 4 bus routes; no direction data  |
| Runs  | Table  | Geodatabase  | TripID, CalendarID; wheelchair and bike columns null  |
| ScheduleElements  | Table  | Geodatabase  | ScheduleID and departure/arrivals |
| Schedules  | Table  | Geodatabase  | shows LineVarID  |

11. Suggestions for further exploration:

- Can schedule data be added to the tables?
- What type of calendar exceptions are they?
- Can we determine how long it will take to go from one stop to another?
- What other tools in the Public Transit toolbox might be useful for our project?

> [!NOTE]
> I've prepared a Word document to share with my group members outlining the steps and results from this task.
> The document has been uploaded to our Group on ArcGIS Online.

## Exploring Mapbox as a web solution

Learn the functionalities of Mapbox and explore it to see if it is a possible web solution to our group project

Duration: 40 mins

### What is Mapbox?

- Mapping and location platform for creating and customizing maps
- Uses APIs and SDKs
- Accounts are free, but many capabilities are not
- Used by many reputable companies (Snapchat, Foursquare, etc.)

### Why is this web solution of interest to our project?

- We need a web solution for our group project
- This web solution has a lot of open-source capabilities, which would make our project available to a wider audience
- Although the product is not free, they may be able to provide free licensing for student projects
- We want to explore the functionalities to see if it is a viable solution to our problem statement

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of Mapbox?

| Advantages  | Disadvantages  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| The user interface has a "crisp look and feel"  | Many of the capabilities require coding  |
| Pricing is flexible, free tier to start  | There isn't documentation on everything  | 
| Super customizable, using API and SDK  | No ability for field data collection  |
| Augmented reality and storytelling options  | Not completely open source as people believe  |
| Has routing and geocoding processes  | Need to pay to use the services  | 
| Tutorials available to follow  |   |

GISGeography. (2024). Mapbox review: 5 things we like. https://gisgeography.com/mapbox/ 

### 'Getting started with Mapbox Standard in Studio' tutorial

Created a Mapbox account and completed the tutorial 'Getting started with Mapbox Standard in Studio,' which can be found here: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/aa-standard-in-studio/

#### What did I do differently?

- Used different font (Poppins instead of Roboto Mono)
- Kept POI labels because I feel that if I were biking, I'd want to know the location of parks
- Removed the transit labels
- Used a different basemap (dusk instead of night)
- Used a different point color (yellow instead of purple)

#### What did I learn?

- Data was added from a GeoJSON file
- The Mapbox Standard interface is very simple and user-friendly
- Emission strength set to 1 means that the feature will appear the same regardless of the basemap style
- 'Slots' allow you to easily order your layers how you want them to appear
    - top: above POI, behind place and transit labels
    - middle: above lines, behind 3D buildings
    - bottom: above polygons
- When you zoom in and alter the direction of the north arrow, the buildings become three-dimensional 
- Publishing is really quick
- You and others can access each other's map styles, if made available to the public

#### Will this be a good web app for our project?

- It'd be neat to view the routes with the three dimensional buildings. This can make travelling easier, as you're able to locate landmarks as you go.
- Need to look more into the capabilities of the free version. Might not have full routing capabilities we are looking for.
- Not everyone in the group is comfortable with coding, so not sure if this is the best application to use.
- Not if we can't get free licensing for student projects.
- In the free account, you have 50,000 free map loads for web - I am assuming we will go beyond this, especially when the map is made available to the public, so Mapbox is not the viable option

#### Final product

## Exploring OpenStreetMap as a web solution

Learn the functionalities of Mapbox and explore it to see if it is a possible web solution to our group project

Duration: 40 mins

### What is OpenStreetMap (OSM)?

- OSM is a free, open-source web map maintained by the public.

### Why is this web solution of interest to our project?

- We need a web solution for our group project
- This web solution is free and open-sourced
- We want to explore the functionalities to see if it is a viable solution to our problem statement.

### My pros and cons about this web solution

| Advantages  | Disadvantages  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Collaborative, any changes you make go live for everyone when saved  | The imagery of the basemap changes depending on the zoom  |
| Very user-friendly  | The buildings and roads don't completely line up  |
| Can edit the map in-browser, without having to download anything  | Cannot do further analysis through OSM, just adding and editing features  |
|   | The data exported isn't just a simple shapefile  |

MapGive. (2014, March 24). Learn how to map in OpenStreetMap [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir-3K0pjwOI

### Explore OSM interface

Visit https://www.openstreetmap.org/ and either create an account or sign in.

> [!TIP]
> If this is your first time logging in, I highly recommend going through the **Walkthrough** to learn how to create and edit points, straight and curved lines, and rectangular and circular areas (polygons). This YouTube video by MapGive is also a great learning tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir-3K0pjwOI.

### Things to note

- The guided tour when you first create an account is very useful. It covers topics such as creating and editing points, straight and curved lines, and rectangular and circular areas (polygons). It is available at any time, if you have to go back to it.

- When adding features to the map, if you accidentally add two nodes too close together, it lets you know and prompts you to edit, remove, or merge them

![OSM editing features](/images/OSM/OSMEditFeature.png)

- Any changes you make go live the when they are saved. This is neat because it means everyone in the world who adds features is contributing to the data, but this can also have a negative impact on the credibility and accuracy of the existing data. How do we know the data being added is correct?

#### Will this be a good web solution for our project?

- The features in Lindsay, Ontario, don't completely line up with the images, which can be problematic when displaying transit routes.

- Does OSM display transit routes?
	- Yes! Change the map layers to **Transport Map** to see the Lindsay Public Transit Route.
	- **However**, this transit route is not up to date - it is currently missing the Orange transit line, which was added in Feb 2023.

![OSM Lindsay transit route](/images/OSM/OSMLindsayTransit.png)

- The data will have to be added to OSM and exported to another application for further processing. 
	- **However**, since this is not a data-focused project, this solution isn't the most efficient one, given our project timeline.

- I tried exporting data, and it downloaded as an .osm file. I need to do further digging into how to process this file in other applications.
	- **However**, again, since this is not a data-focused project, this solution isn't the most efficient one, given our project timeline.

- No analysis can be done on the data within OSM, just simple points, lines, and polygons can be added to the map.

## Using the LIO Basemap

Learn why it is advantageous for us to use LIO basemap

Duration: 15 mins

### What is LIO?

- LIO = Land Information Ontario
- provides to the public a cached basemap of the province of Ontario in ArcGIS Server

### Why use this basemap?

- it shows the natural and constructed features of Ontario's landscape
- it is constantly being updated
- it is open sourced data, so we can use it in our project
- the feature symbologies are intuitive (e.g., blue = water, known symbols for marsh, road/path networks, etc.)
	- **however**, there is no 
- our study area is Lindsay, Ontario, so its boundaries will be included within the basemap
- the shown features update as you zoom in, showing more or less depending on the zoom level - prevents overcrowding of data
	- **however**, if relying on landmarks to navigate the transit system, this layer probably isn't the most effective for that

### How can you access this basemap?

#### Through Rest API URL

- URL: https://ws.lioservices.lrc.gov.on.ca/arcgis1061a/rest/services/LIO_Cartographic/LIO_Topographic/MapServer
- From here you can see the JavaScript, add it to ArcGIS Online Map Viewer, and other applications
- View the layers that are included in this map service

#### Through ArcGIS Online 

- Access the basemap at the item page on AGOL: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=547ee954b12341e0be4f907ed4d06b5d
- From here you can ```Open in Map Viewer``` and add layers to it.
- I completed these steps and overlain the Lindsay transit route and shared it with the group in AGOL.

Duration: 30 mins

### What is it?

- Experience Builder is a web application that allows you to create a web app with custom data and themes, without coding

### Advantages and disadvantages of ArcGIS Experience Builder

| Advantages  | Disadvantages  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Many templates to choose from  | Can be time consuming to create  |

## Exploring Experience Builder (Part 2)

Learn how to customize the Experience Builder interface

Duration: 60 mins

### What was added to the experience?

- legend
- directions widget
- table for bus stop schedules, available for all routes in a dropdown menu
- table for the fare prices
- bus stops were added to the map
- footer was added to recognize course and college
- button was added to allow users to download the pdf of the map (https://www.kawarthalakes.ca/en/living-here/resources/Transit/COKL-Transit-Map-2023.pdf)
- orange color scheme was used to match Kawartha Lakes website (https://www.kawarthalakes.ca/en/living-here/lindsay-transit.aspx)

![Lindsay Transit EB v2](/images/ArcGISExperience/EBLindsay2.png)

### What happened when Directions widget was added?

- I tried the directions widget, but I wasn't able to connect it to the transit data
- I tried publishing the experience and it notified me that there may be credits used to access the Routes geocoded layer in the Directions widget
- I ended up deleting the widget to avoid the additional costs

![EB credit warning](/images/ArcGISExperience/EBCreditWarning.png)

### Next steps

- add a trigger to filter the bus stop times based on what time it is on the user's device
- add logos??
- fix field name headings in data
- add a legend
	- filter the legend so that it doesn't show the basemap and LIO map
	- perhaps combine the bus stop layers to condense the size of the legend

## Exploring Leaflet (Part 1)

Learn about the functionalities of Leaflet as an open-source web solution

Duration: 30 mins

### What is Leaflet?

- A JS library used to create interactive mobile web solutions

### Why is this web solution of interest to our project?

- We need a web solution for our group project
- This web solution is free and open-sourced
- We want to explore the functionalities to see if it is a viable solution to our problem statement

| Advantages  | Disadvantages  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| compatible with mobile phones  | uses JavaScript, and not everyone on the team is fully comfortable with that  |
| it is open source and free  |   |
| plethora of JS properties organized by type/usage  |   |
| tutorials available  |   |

### Download Leaflet 

1. Visit https://leafletjs.com/download.html 

2. Click on the latest stable version of Leaflet (in my case, Leaflet 1.9.4)

3. Unzip the downloaded folder and store in your website's directory

4. Include this line of code to the head of your HTML code

	```
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/leaflet.css" />
	<script src="/path/to/leaflet.js"></script>
	```

#### What's included in the download

| File/Folder  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| leaflet.js  | minified Leaflet JavaScript code  |
| leaflet.js.map  | map file for minified code  |
| leaflet-src.js  | readable, unminified Leaflet JavaScript, which can be helpful for debugging  |
| leaflet-src.js.map  | map file for unminified code  |
| leaflet-src.esm.js  | unminified code, esm game file  |
| leaflet-src.esm.js.map  | map file for esm game file  |
| leaflet.css  | stylesheet  |
| images  | contains images referenced by the stylesheet, must stay in same directory as css  |

#### What is an .esm file?

I've never seen this file before - had to do a bit of research...

- ESM files hold game data, including characters, in-game items, world environments, and settings
- developed by Betheseda Softworks
- you need special software to open the file directly

FileInfo.com. (2012). *.ESM file extension.* https://fileinfo.com/extension/esm
Filext. (2024). *Opening an ESM file.* https://filext.com/file-extension/ESM

#### Will this be a good web solution for our project?

- **Yes**, since it is compatible with mobile phones, this makes it accessible for someone who is out using public transit
- **No**, not the most efficient solution because it requires a lot of customization, which will take time

14. Here is my demo: https://helenplesko.github.io/leaflettest/index.html 

![leaflet test 1](/images/Leaflet/LeafletTut1.png)

### Take aways

- The GTFS data will have to be converted to geojson so it can be used with Leaflet
- This will require a lot of customization, so I'm not sure if this is the most efficient web solution for our group project

## Convert shapefile to geojson

Use an online geodata converter to convert shapefiles to geojson files

Duration: 30 mins

> [!NOTE]
> Converting a shapefile to geojson can also be done in ArcGIS Pro, using the **Features to JSON** Conversion Tool.
> However, since we are looking for web solutions, the online converter was used instead.
> More about the ArcGIS Pro tool can be found here: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.1/tool-reference/conversion/features-to-json.htm

### NOTE

- I found this information on how to convert GTFS data to GeoJSON: https://gtfs.org/resources/gtfs/#:~:text=gtfs%2Dto%2Dgeojson%20%2D%20Javascript,creating%20maps%20of%20transit%20routes.
- But I was unsure of how to use it in GitHub, so I went searching for an online converter to help me.
- I instead found a shapefile to geojson converter, and I already had the shapefiles of routes and stops from Ontario GeoHub, so I used that.
- However, this data is NOT up to date (no orange line), which I will have to bring to the group's attention at the next meeting.
- **This was done for exploration purposes, so I can see how the geojson file works in Leaflet**

### Steps

1. Visit MyGeodata Converter website at: https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/

2. Under **Available Conversions**
	- Choose ```ESRI Shapefile``` as the input format
	- Choose ```GeoJSON``` as the output format
	- Click ```Check```
	- The site will confirm that the conversion is supported
	- Click ```Convert SHP to GeoJSON```

![avail conversions](/images/Leaflet/shptogeojson0.png)

3. Under **Upload your SHP File and Convert**
	- Click ```Or browse files to convert``` to find them in your file explorer

![upload shp to converter](/images/Leaflet/shptogeojson1.png)

4. Click ```Add files...``` to upload your zipped shapefile

![add files](/images/Leaflet/shptogeojson2.png)

5. Review the **Input Data**, **Output Data**, and **Conversion**, then click ```Convert now!```

> [!NOTE]
> Optionally, you can click **Show in a Map** to view the shapefile on a map

![review data](/images/Leaflet/shptogeojson3.png)

6. Review the **Conversion Result** and click ```Download```

![review and download](/images/Leaflet/shptogeojson4.png)

7. Repeat for each shapefile

8. Add the geoJSON files to ArcGIS Online shared group

### Video: Create a geoJSON File and Add to Leaflet

GIS Solutions. (2022, August 26). Create a geoJSON file and add to Leaflet [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A32HNVgcMkE

1. Copy the geojson code from the newly converted files

2. In the script portion of the body of the html file
	- add ``` var geojson = ```
	- paste the geojson after the equal sign

3. On the line after the geojson code
	- add ```L.geoJSON(geojson).addTo(map)```

4. ```Save``` and ```Commit changes```, then view the result
	- the result can be seen here: https://helenplesko.github.io/leaflettest/geojsontransit.html

![geojson leaflet 1](/images/Leaflet/shptogeojson5.png)

5. Edit the code again to customize the page
	- zoom in
	- remove the pop up
	- change the appearance of the point features
	- change the color of the routes
