## Project Overview
A group of four GIS students are exploring web solutions to find a user-friendly web application that will best help the general public navigate around Lindsay, Ontario, through public transportation.

## Uploading Lindsay transit data to ArcGIS Online

Learn how to download public data from an ArcGIS Hub and upload it to ArcGIS Online as a hosted feature service

Assumption(s):
- User has an ArcGIS Account

Duration: 15 mins

### Steps

1. Visit the public **ArcGIS Hub** where Lindsay transit data are located: https://hub.arcgis.com/documents/ca68660b0e3e47a09a667d2f0963df99/about 

2. Browse the available data under **You may be interested in**.

3. Click ```Bus Routes``` feature service to bring you to an overview of its service.

4. Click ```Download``` to bring you to a list of **Download Options**.

5. In this case, we want the **Shapefile**. Find the shapefile on the list, click ```Download```. The zipfile including all shapefile data will automatically start downloading to the computer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the folder zipped! ArcGIS Online will want you to upload a new item in a zipped file.

6. In a separate browser, sign into **ArcGIS Online**: https://www.arcgis.com/index.html# 

7. Once signed in, click ```Content```.

8. To keep files organized, on the lefthand side, click the ```folder icon``` next to **Folders** to create a new folder, where you will be storing the new items.

9. When in the folder, click ```New item``` at the top lefthand side of the page.

10. Drag and drop the zipped folder onto the page. AGOL will show that it is recognizes the uploaded folder was a **shapefile**.

11. We want the **zipped folder** AND the **hosted feature layer**, so select ```Add ___.zip and create a hosted feature layer```. Click ```Next```.

12. Give your shapefile a proper **name** and click ```Save```.

13. The shapefile will now appear in your AGOL with its associated hosted feature layer!

14. Repeat all steps for Lindsay's Bus Stops
