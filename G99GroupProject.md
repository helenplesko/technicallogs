## Project Overview

**About the Project**

A group of four GIS students are exploring web solutions to find a user-friendly web application that will best help the general public navigate around Lindsay, Ontario, through public transportation.

## Uploading Lindsay transit data to ArcGIS Online

Learn how to download public data from an ArcGIS Hub and upload it to ArcGIS Online as a hosted feature service

Assumption(s):
- User has an ArcGIS Account

Duration: 15 mins

### Steps

1. Visit the public **ArcGIS Hub** where Lindsay transit data are located: https://hub.arcgis.com/documents/ca68660b0e3e47a09a667d2f0963df99/about 

2. Browse the available data under **You may be interested in**.

3. Click ```Bus Routes``` feature service to bring you to an overview of its service.

4. Click ```Download``` to bring you to a list of **Download Options**.

5. In this case, we want the **Shapefile**. Find the shapefile on the list, click ```Download```. The zipfile including all shapefile data will automatically start downloading to the computer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the folder zipped! ArcGIS Online will want you to upload a new item in a zipped file.

6. In a separate browser, sign into **ArcGIS Online**: https://www.arcgis.com/index.html# 

7. Once signed in, click ```Content```.

8. To keep files organized, on the lefthand side, click the ```folder icon``` next to **Folders** to create a new folder, where you will be storing the new items.

9. When in the folder, click ```New item``` at the top lefthand side of the page.

10. Drag and drop the zipped folder onto the page. AGOL will show that it is recognizes the uploaded folder was a **shapefile**.

11. We want the **zipped folder** AND the **hosted feature layer**, so select ```Add ___.zip and create a hosted feature layer```. Click ```Next```.

12. Give your shapefile a proper **name** and click ```Save```.

13. The shapefile will now appear in your AGOL with its associated hosted feature layer!

14. Repeat all steps for Lindsay's Bus Stops

:tada: *Congratulations! You have now learned how to upload the Lindsay, Ontario, transit data to ArcGIS Online*

> [!TIP]
> Click the hosted feature layer and view in Map Viewer to see the data on a map.

> [!WARNING]
> After further inspection of the data, it was discovered that some bus stops were missing. Further processing must be done to ensure the general public can rely on the data to navigate around the city.

## Exploring Public Transit Toolbox in ArcGIS Pro

Learn about the capabilities of the Public Transit Toolbox in ArcGIS Pro

Duration: 30 mins

### What is the Public Transit Toolbox?

- Toolbox in ArcGIS Pro that is used for displaying, converting, editing, and analyzing public transit data
- In this toolbox, there is an analysis toolset and a conversion toolset
	- analysis toolset used to analyze public transit data
	- conversion toolset used to convert to/from GTFS datasets

### Why is this toolbox of interest?

- Since our group is working with public transit data, we decided to explore the tools within this toolbox
- We have GTFS Lindsay transit data, which can be processed using these tools

### GTFS to Public Transit Data Model

Learn how to use the **General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) to Public Transit Data Model** tool to convert the GTFS data to a set of feature classes and tables that represent the transit data

Assumption(s):
- You have an ArcGIS Account with access to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online
- You already have the GTFS csv files downloaded

Duration: 30 mins

#### Steps

1. Open up a new project map in ArcGIS Pro. Save the project in a directory of your choice.

2. In the **Catalog Pane**:
    - Right click on ```Folders```
    - Click ```Add Folder Connection```
    - Navigate to the folder where your CSV files are saved on your local computer
	- Click ```OK```.
	- Expand the newly connected folder to see its contents

3. Once the folder connection is made, click the ```Analysis``` tab:
	- Click ```Environments```
	- Click the globe next to **Output Coordinate System**
	- Choose Coordinate System **NAD 1983 CSRS UTM ZONE 17N**
	- Click ```OK```

4. In the **Catalog Pane**:
	- Right click on your **geodatabase**
	- Click ```New```
	- Click ```Feature Dataset```
	- Ensure the **Output Geodatabase** is the one youâ€™d like to store it in
	- Give the feature dataset a meaningful **name**
	- Ensure the **coordinate system** is the same one set in the environments
	- Click ```Run```

5. Click the ```Analysis``` tab 

6. Click ```Tools```

7. In the **Toolboxes** directory:
	- Click ```Public Transit Tools``` to expand the toolbox
	- Click ```Conversion``` to expand the toolset
	- Click ```GTFS to Public Transit Data Model```
	- This will bring up the **GTFS to Public Transit Data Model** Geoprocessing window

8. In the **Geoprocessing Window**:
	- For **Input GTFS Folders**, find the folder that olds your csv files
	- For **Target Feature Dataset**, choose the newly made feature dataset
	- Leave all other defaults
	- Click ```Run```

> [!NOTE]
> The target feature dataset chosen must not already have public transit data model feature classes within it.
> If the geodatabase being used is enterprise, it must not be versioned.

9. The feature classes and table will automatically be added to the map.

10. Explore the new data

| Item  | Type  | Location  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| LineVariantElements  | Line  | Feature Dataset  | shows the route of the transit vehicle  |
| Stops  | Point  | Feature Dataset  | shows the bus stops  |
| CalendarExceptions  | Table  | Geodatabase  | ServiceID, ExceptionDate, ExceptionType |
| Calendars  | Table  | Geodatabase  | Empty; shows GServiceID, days of the week, StartDate and EndDate  |
| Lines  | Table  | Geodatabase  | shows 4 bus routes and route type  |
| LineVariants  | Table  | Geodatabase  | shows 4 bus routes; no direction data  |
| Runs  | Table  | Geodatabase  | TripID, CalendarID; wheelchair and bike columns null  |
| ScheduleElements  | Table  | Geodatabase  | ScheduleID and departure/arrivals |
| Schedules  | Table  | Geodatabase  | shows LineVarID  |

11. Suggestions for further exploration:

- Can schedule data be added to the tables?
- What type of calendar exceptions are they?
- Can we determine how long it will take to go from one stop to another?
- What other tools in the Public Transit toolbox might be useful for our project?

Learn the functionalities of QGIS and explore it to see if it is a possible web solution to our group project

Assumption(s):
- Transit data has been already downloaded

Duration:
