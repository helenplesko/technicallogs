### Things to consider before creating your Hub

- What is the purpose of your Hub?
- Who is your audience? 
- Who will be able to access the data in your hub?
- What theme do you want your Hub to follow (e.g., colors, images, fonts, etc.)

### Would Hub be useful for our collaborative project?

- **Yes**, client wants us to be able to share data internally and externally
- **Yes**, you don't need a lot of coding experience to use this web solution
- **No**, the site is it's own hub domain, whereas the client wants everything accessed through their own existing domain
